 First, do what you want with the original work, just do not act like an asshole.

     To act like an asshole means - but is not limited to - the following cases:

	 1a. And utter Copyright Infringement - Copy not only plant and rename it.  
	 1b. Sell ​​a omodiefierad version of the work without having done something yourself over
	 at all, then you're really an asshole.  
	 1c. Modifying the original work to include malicious content. Then you
	 really a prime example of an asshole.  

 2nd If you become rich through modifications related to the work / service, or support the 
 original work,
 spread the love. Only an asshole would earn big bucks at work without inviting the lave
 creators without inviting them to a pint.
 
 Third code is provided without warranty. Using someone else's code and then bitching when something
 goes wrong means you're an asshole properly. Fix the problem yourself. A non-ass
 would provide a fix.
